                                    Starting with my masterâ€™s thesis on object-orientation for a simulation project and creating my own modeling language, I
                                    have been involved in numerous full life-cycle projects over the past 20 years. I have
                                    tremendous energy, enthusiasm and dedication in leading enterprise systems design, implementation
                                    and support. My strong points are extreme perseverance resulting in solutions of issues,
                                    completion of projects and adaptation to new technologies. I bring the kind of leadership
                                    to a team that instills confidence and pride.

                            <p>Delivering many Complex Enterprise Systems for the last 25 years, I believe I have the knowledge
                                and skills to delve into any domain and deliver systems implementation from the ground up.
                                My previous work at Intercontinental Exchange further enhanced my ability to deliver high-availability
                                and extreme performance systems while collaborating with highly skilled engineers. While
                                building a router management system single handedly from the ground up, I worked with operations,
                                Java developers, performance engineers, database administrators and Smalltalk developers.
                                I architected and built a deal adjusting system while working closely with business. I streamlined
                                and improved and implemented an options market generation system among many other projects.</p>
