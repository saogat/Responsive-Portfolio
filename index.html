                                Starting with my masterâ€™s thesis on object-orientation for a simulation project and creating my own modeling language, I
                                have been involved in numerous full life-cycle projects over the past 20 years. I have tremendous
                                energy, enthusiasm and dedication in leading enterprise systems design, implementation and
                                support. My strong points are extreme perseverance resulting in solutions of issues, completion
                                of projects and adaptation to new technologies. I bring the kind of leadership to a team
                                that instills confidence and pride.

                        <p>Delivering many Complex Enterprise Systems for the last 25 years, I believe I have the knowledge
                            and skills to delve into any domain and deliver systems implementation from the ground up. My
                            previous work at Intercontinental Exchange further enhanced my ability to deliver high-availability
                            and extreme performance systems while collaborating with highly skilled engineers. While building
                            a router management system single handedly from the ground up, I worked with operations, Java
                            developers, performance engineers, database administrators and Smalltalk developers. I architected
                            and built a deal adjusting system while working closely with business. I streamlined and improved
                            and implemented an options market generation system among many other projects.</p>
